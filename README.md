In this project I looked at apps on Google Play store and the Apple store to try determine potential app genres/categories that may be profitable.

In this project I looked at posts from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to determine the best time of day to post, and also which types of posts recieve more comments on average.

3. [Exploring eBay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/olivermills/Dataquest-Projects/blob/master/2.%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualisation/Exploring%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data/eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb) - In this project I looked at a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section on the German eBay website. The original dataset isn't available on Kaggle anymore, but you can find it [here](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data). The purpose of this project was to practice some basic data cleansing techniques, and perform some basic data analysis on the cleansed dataset.
